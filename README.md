# Building a Network Graph using Microsoft Power BI
This project builds a Network Graph to visualize the sample sales data from the Microsoft AdventureWorks sample database.

# Goals
The goal of this project is to answer some of the most commonly asked questions by executives on the sales data, such as:
* What products are sold?
* Where are products sold to?
* How many products are sold or how much are products sold for?
* Are there any correlation between product and customer geographical locations?
* For a brand new product, where should it be marketed and sold to?

**For a detailed discussion on the visualization, please see my recent article, Data Science â€” Building a Network Graph in Power BI using SQL Server** (link: https://medium.com/@ss.shawnshi/data-science-building-a-network-graph-in-power-bi-using-sql-server-a1b4c9b7610a)
